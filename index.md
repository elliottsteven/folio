# Just playing around on GitHub Pages

I'm just experimenting to see how much I could feasibly do using GitHub Pages. Having the most basic coding skills, I'm not sure I'll get very far.
I've used markdown in [Ghost](https://www.ghost.io) before so that may be useful. I'm also using a Jekyll theme so it should look presentable.

## What I'd like to be able to do
- Create and edit pages
- Insert images
- Create some basic navigation

## See my current Projects
Here's a [second page on the website](https://elliottsteven.github.io/folio/projects) where I link off to my current projects.

### Internal notes for my consumption only

I'm leaving this link to [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) here for my future reference.

Change the Jekyll theme selected in [repository settings](https://github.com/elliottsteven/folio/settings). The name of this theme (Minimal) is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
